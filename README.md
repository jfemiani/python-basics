# Python Basics

This is a single notebook that I have put together for teaching python. There are many, many, many python tutorials on the web. However, I wanted one that was under my control. 

I am sure it has its warts -- this was a huge thing to put together rather quickly. I hope I can  elicit support from students and TAs to help me to improve it over time. 

It is very much based on the official python documentation, with code cells and examples pulled from there, as well as much of the outline. 

I use this as a prop for a video on YouTube:
