I will ask some of my students specifically to help to improve it in the following ways:

1. It is currently incomplete. Eventually I will finish it (covering intput, output, and  classes).   If you can add material based on the official python tutorial I would live it. 
2. Remove reduncancy. 
   I created this notebook while recording a video as I read the tutorial, and I would show some concepts I thought were important only to find the same ideas presented later in the tutorial. I just included them twice in the notebook, but that is not ideal. 
3. Link to parts of the video
   In the markdown cells, it would be nice to link to the moment that the section was discussed in the longer vide.
4. Additional information on setup
